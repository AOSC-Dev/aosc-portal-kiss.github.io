Do you have a server or desktop computer with uptimes longer than a year? Well,
[Kevin](https://www.yyzkevin.com/) certainly has one.

A year ago today, Kevin installed AOSC OS/Retro on his [IBM Palm Top PC 110](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Palm_Top_PC_110)
and deployed a simple BusyBox Web server on it. The [website](http://pc110.yyzkevin.com)
hosts a simple message, a picture of the server in question, and a "CGI"-based
system status page... All on a 33MHz Intel 486SL processor and 20MiB of RAM.

*And guess what, it's still up!*

Besides a celebratory [Wayback Machine snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20220428112321/http://pc110.yyzkevin.com/),
here are some screenshots before it goes down in flames, now that it made the news...
