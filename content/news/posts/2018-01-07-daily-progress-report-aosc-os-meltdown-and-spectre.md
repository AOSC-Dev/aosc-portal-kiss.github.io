Here's a follow up to yesterday's [Progress Report](https://aosc.io/news/2326-progress-report-aosc-os-meltdown-and-spectre) on the fixing of "Meltdown" and "Spectre" for AOSC OS. Several events have taken place in the past 24 hours:

- Kernels. We have been able to produce and test both "LTS" and "Main" Kernels to address these security concerns. Please update to 4.9.75 (for "LTS") and 4.14.12 (for "Main") as soon as possible.
- Browsers. A statement from our resident vulnerability tracker Zero King cited a link from Google Support:

*"Current stable versions of Chrome include an optional feature called Site Isolation which can be enabled to provide mitigation by isolating websites into separate address spaces. Learn more about Site Isolation and how to take action to enable it [from this [link](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7622138#chrome)].*

*"Chrome 64, due to be released on January 23, will contain mitigations to protect against exploitation."*

At this moment, no other progress has been made on other issues stated on the last report.
