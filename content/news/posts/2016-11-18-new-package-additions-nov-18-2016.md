Per users' requests, we have added the following packages to our [community repository](https://repo.aosc.io/):

- `htdig` - Scripts and HTML code needed for using ht://Dig as a web search engine.
- `ibus-uniemoji` - Emoji and symbol input support for IBus.
- `ltrace` - A debugging program which runs a specified command until the command exits.
- `pwgen` - Automatic password generator.
- `siege` - An HTTP regression testing and benchmarking utility.
- `devmem2` - Simple program to read/write from/to any location in memory.
- `dislocker` - Read BitLocker encrypted volumes under Linux.

Special changes to existing packages this week:

- `google-chrome` is now provided as a binary repack, so there is no need to fight with the downloader in some... less convenient locations.
