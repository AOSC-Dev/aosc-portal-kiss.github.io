Please update your `glibc` package to version `2.24-2`, especially if you are using ARMv7 (`armel`).

A fix was recently committed to Glibc's Git master to fix the following vulnerability:

[CVE-2016-6323](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6323)

And the vulnerability states:

*"The makecontext function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.25 creates execution contexts incompatible with the unwinder on ARM EABI (32-bit) platforms, which might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (hang), as demonstrated by applications compiled using gccgo, related to backtrace generation."*
