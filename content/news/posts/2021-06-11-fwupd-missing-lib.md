title: "[SOLVED] fwupd May Not Be Able to Update and Install Device Firmwares"

Currently `fwupd` is unable to use the LVFS (Linux Vendor Firmware Service)
update checking and installation feature due to missing `libsmbios_c.so.2`.
We will release a fix as soon as possible.

The fix has already been merged into the stable repository.
