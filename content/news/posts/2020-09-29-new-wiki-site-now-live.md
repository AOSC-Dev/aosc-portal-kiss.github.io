Thanks to the hard work from Leo Shen along with other community contributors,
a new Wiki site is [now live](https://wiki.aosc.io/)!

Our new Wiki, unlike our old old, JavaScript-infested, Wiki.js-based site, uses
[Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) - a lightweight, single-binary static site
generator. The resulting site is much lighter on both our server and your
computer, for the lack of JavaScript for the most part (save for the search
bar, there wasn't anything we could do).

Enjoy our new, localised, and clean Wiki site!

*And oh, this site is highly usable even on NetSurf, pre-installed with every
AOSC OS/Retro distributions - coming soon to your neighbourhood retro computing
clubs!*
