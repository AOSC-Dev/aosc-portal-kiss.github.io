title: Pre-built AOSC OS Wallpapers now available

I have just built the AOSC OS wallpapers for Core 4.0.0 (with date tag 20160916). Just unpack and copy all the files into your root directory.

If you are not using a Linux desktop, you may find all the built PNG files in `usr/share/backgrounds/core4`.

You may get all the prebuilt wallpapers [here](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/aosc-os-artworks/releases/tag/v20160916).
