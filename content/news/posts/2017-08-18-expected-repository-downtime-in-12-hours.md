title: Expected Repository Downtime in ~12 Hours

---


Due to damaged high voltage power lines and equipment at our host for community repository, we are expecting an one-day downtime for this server.

At the meantime, we would recommend that you:

- Choose another repository mirror with `apt-gen-list`.
- Prevent installing packages or updating your AOSC OS, as mirrors may be incompletely synchronised (if they were forced to terminate mid-way when the servers go out).

--------

We apologise for any inconvenience. 

Here below is a copy of the original announcement from our server host [OSSPlanet](http://ossplanet.net/):

```
MAINTENANCE DOWNTIME:  2017/8/19 9am-4pm CST (1am-8am UTC)
In short: Tomorrow.

We are going to have a maintenance downtime for damaged High Voltage 
power lines and equipment (ATS) to prevent further unexpected issues
in case of power outage.
Please shutdown your VMs before 7am CST (8/18 23:00 UTC) to prevent any 
data lose.

We're sorry for the inconveniences.
If you need any assistance, please feel free to contact us.
