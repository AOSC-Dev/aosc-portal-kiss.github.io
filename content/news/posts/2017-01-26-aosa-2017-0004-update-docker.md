Please update your `docker` package to version `0.12.6`.

A security vulnerability was recently disclosed by Docker developer Nathan McCauley:

*"RunC allowed additional container processes via `runc exec` to be ptraced
by the pid 1 of the container.  This allows the main processes of the
container, if running as root, to gain access to file-descriptors of these
new processes during the initialization and can lead to container escapes
or modification of runC state before the process is fully placed inside the
container"*

And was assigned with the following CVE ID:

[CVE-2016-9962](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9962).
