*Summer's ending, and we thought a year wouldn't be complete without an AOSCC,
so here goes!*

COVID-19 and AOSCC 2020
-----------------------

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this year's AOSCC will be held online.

Apart from the switch to online attendance, we have also decided to shorten
and simplify this year's agenda. In particular, Day 1 (September 26th) agenda
starts at 10:00 (UTC +8) and will end in the evening; Day 2 (September 27th)
agenda starts at 10:00 and will end at 18:00 (UTC +8). All agenda will be held
consequtively at our Discord #general [voice channel](https://discord.gg/VYPHgt9).

What to Expect at AOSCC
-----------------------

As we have shortened our agenda, there will be a decline in this year's content
diversity.

We will cut to the chase on Day 1 with three community (project) reports by our
community contributors (with a 2-hour Q&A/Lunch break interval between the
second and third agenda). Following the reports, AOSC OS maintainers will hold
an open meeting to discuss this year's switch to a topic-based maintenance
routine, deprecating our current system of seasonal iteration cycles.

On Day 2, we will hold a workshop, we welcome all community members to join in
and learn packaging for AOSC OS. This will be a great opportunity to become
one of our (now over 50) contributors.

Language Usage at AOSCC
-----------------------

AOSCC 2020, its lectures, discussions, and workshop activities will be
delivered/held in Mandarin Chinese. If you do not speak this language, please
note at time of each activity and we will try our best to accomodate (most
likely in English).
