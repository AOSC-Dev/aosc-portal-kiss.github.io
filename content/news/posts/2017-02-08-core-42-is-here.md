Core 4.2 was just released as the latest feature update to the Core 4.0 series. With 4.2, we have updated virtually every single component in the Core, but more importantly, we have officially added support for the MIPS64 Little Endian architecture, currently maintained by [Junde Yhi](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/lmy441900) (creation of build specifications, and package porting) and [Mingcong Bai](https://github.com/MingcongBai/) (package porting).

What's more? You could expect, with Core 4.2:

- Improved network performance.
- Security enhancements.
- Component updates.

Core 4.2 is now readily available for the AMD64/x86_64 port of AOSC OS, updates for all other architectures will come in this upcoming weekend.

Please note that Core 4.2 contains security updates, which were assigned with [AOSA-2017-0018](https://aosc.io/news/aosa-2017-0018-update-glibc) (for GNU C Library) and [AOSA-2017-0019](https://aosc.io/news/aosa-2017-0019-update-bash) (for Bash). Please update your AOSC OS with the newest Core at your earliest convenience!
