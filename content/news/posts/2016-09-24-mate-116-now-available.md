MATE Desktop 1.16 is now available in the community repository for AOSC OS.

*"After 6 months of development the MATE Desktop team are proud to announce the release of MATE Desktop 1.16. We’d like to thank every MATE contributor for their help making this release possible."*

MATE Desktop 1.16 is a major update over version 1.14 released six months ago:

- More fixes to GTK+ 3 support.
- Migrated multiple applications to the new GApplications API.

While it might sound pretty trivial to you, in other words: MATE Desktop 1.16 should provide a more stable and modern user experience, and possibly some less bugs as well!
