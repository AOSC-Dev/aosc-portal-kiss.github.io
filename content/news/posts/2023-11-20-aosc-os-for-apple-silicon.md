AOSC OS for Apple Silicon is now available for most M1 or M2 based Macs. This
round of release will work out of the box on most M1-based systems[^1], with
the exception of OpenGL[^2] and Thunderbolt[^3], the internal storage, ports,
audio, Wi-Fi, and webcam should work out of the box. Support for M2 devices is
currently work-in-progress[^4] and M3 support will be coming soon.

On macOS Ventura (13) or newer, use following command in terminal to install
AOSC OS:

```
curl https://releases.aosc.io/install-asahi | sh
```
