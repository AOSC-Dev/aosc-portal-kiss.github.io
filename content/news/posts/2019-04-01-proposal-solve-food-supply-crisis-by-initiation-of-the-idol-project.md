Dear friends of the community,

Today I would like to make aware that the AOSC Oxygen, Silicon, and Carbon Cycle Systematic Operation Agency (AOSCCSOA) has run into its greatest crisis since its establishment in 2011.

As we may all know, the AOSC is a community of organisms originated from Earth that can conduct biological activities such as packaging [_in silico_](https://enwp.org/in_silico). However, as all of us are still bound by the [second law of thermodynamics](https://enwp.org/second_law_of_thermodynamics), we have to obtain energy from outside sources in order to maintain the _in silico_ biological activities that potentially reduces [entropy](https://enwp.org/entropy) progressing. The AOSCCSOA, the agency responsible for the continuous supply of energy needed by the member organisms of AOSC to maintain _in silico_ biological activities, is currently reporting a huge loss in the latest annual report. This is mainly due to the reduced production and uncontrolled increase in prices of the sole carbon source for AOSC member organisms: the Anthon [_Oryza sativa_](https://enwp.org/Oryza_sativa) Collection. Without a continuous supply of energy, the AOSC community's continual functioning is at risk.

We as AOSC member organisms are trying hard to support our AOSCCSOA operation. This is done by attempting to consume alternative energy sources such as [maize](https://enwp.org/maize) and [tater](https://enwp.org/potato), as well as reducing reproductivity through [quorum sensing](https://enwp.org/quorum_sensing) to reduce energy consumption. The aquatic division of the AOSC, especially the [Salted Fish](https://github.com/RedL0tus), has successfully achieved the goal of energy cut on parallelism by stopping all vital processes for individuals containing results that would be discarded. On the other hand, microbes such as [_S. aureus_](https://github.com/StephDC) had also reached stationary phase of the growth curve to limit energy consumption. These activities, while at a cost to the productivity of the AOSC community, did manage to help maintain the AOSCCSOA's operation for the past few months. However, as the summer is approaching and unfortunately, all the crops are not yet prune, the stress on the supply chain would soon reach record high since the Agency's establishment.

Knowing that the AOSCCSOA may cease operation at any moment, we as member organisms have come the consensus that a major undertaking is imperative to save the community. We have learned that Idol Projects are really popular on the global scale and has the ability to provide enough for our AOSCCSOA to operate until the harvest of this year's first Anthon _Oryza sativa_ Collection, so we have determined that this is the way to go.

During a test run on Mar. 16, 2019, our first two Idols, Chief Executive [Jelly Bai](https://github.com/MingcongBai) and member [Lion](https://github.com/LionNatsu), went public and received significant amount of support from our users and other that may have never heard of us. In the following weeks, other members of community will also go live and perform our important _in silico_ biological processes. We hope that such activities would bring us enough support and help us through one more year of fighting against the Entropy and taking care of all architectures we could support. Please follow us on the [Community Portal](https://aosc.io/) and our [GitHub Organization Home](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev). The realization of our ultimate goals relies on your continued support.
