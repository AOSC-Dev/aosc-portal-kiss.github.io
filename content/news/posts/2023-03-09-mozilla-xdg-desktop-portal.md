With the upcoming Firefox 110.0.1 and Thunderbird 102.8.0 updates, we have began to make use of XDG Desktop Portal to allow using desktop-environment-native file dialogs. This change should improve the experience while using both applications in KDE.

However, as XDG Desktop Portal support needs to start with desktop environment sessions, you may need to restart AOSC OS. Otherwise, file dialogs may stop working.
