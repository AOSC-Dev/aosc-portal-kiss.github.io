title: "[SOLVED] Recent kmod 31 Update May Prevent System from Booting"

We have since issued kernel updates to address this issue. You may now update
your system as usual. If you have held `kmod`'s package version, please use
the following command to unhold:

```
sudo oma mark unhold kmod
```

Thank you for your patience and our apologies for any inconvenience caused.

The `modprobe` utility in recently updated kmod 31 uses a potentially broken
module loading code path in the kernel, and may prevent xz-compressed modules
from loading. As AOSC OS currently ships all kernel modules xz-compressed,
modules will fail to load during early boot in initrd stage and in most cases
prevent the system from booting:

```
decompression failed with status 6
systemd[1]: Failed to start systemd-module-load.service.
dracut: FATAL: iscsiroot requested but kernel/initrd does not support iscsi
```

If you have updated your system, please downgrade `kmod` to `30-1` immediately:

```
sudo oma install kmod:30-1
```

If you have not yet updated your system, please refrain from updating or hold
your `kmod` version to `30-1`:

```
sudo oma mark hold kmod
```

We will identify the root cause of this problem and issue an update as soon as
possible.
