title: "[SOLVED] Recent Thunderbird Update May Have Incorrect UI Scaling"

Due to a maintainer oversight, the recent Thunderbird (`thunderbird`) v115.2.2 update may come with excessively small and dense UI. This was caused by incorrect font and layout configuration overrides in the package. We will release a v115.2.2-1 update in short order to address this issue, you would not need to change any settings.
