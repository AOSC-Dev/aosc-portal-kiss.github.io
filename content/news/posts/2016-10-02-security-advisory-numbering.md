While there really isn't many security advisories posted here on the new portal just yet, it might get harder to index and query such advisories as time goes by (there should be at least four to five posted per week, go figure).

Therefore, a numbering system will be introduced in the following format:

    AOSA-$YEAR-$NUM

Where:

- `AOSC` stands for "AOSC OS Security Advisory".
- `$YEAR` is a four digit designation for the year when the advisory was posted.
- `$NUM` is a four digit designation for the incrementing number for each of the advisories.

This will be effective by the next security advisory to be posted, and note that previously posted advisories **will be** edited to assign each with an advisory number.
