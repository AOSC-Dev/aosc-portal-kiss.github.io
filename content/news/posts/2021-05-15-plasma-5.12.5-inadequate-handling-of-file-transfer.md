title: "Plasma 5.12.5 Update May Fail to Complete Due to Inadequate File Handling"

You may not be able to correctly install the recent Plasma 5.12.5 update due to 
inadequate handling of file transfer between `plasma-workspace` and `plasma-desktop`.
We will release a fix as soon as possible.

For now, as a workaround, you may execute the following command:

    apt -f install
    apt full-upgrade

Once the upgrade finishes, the system should function normally.
