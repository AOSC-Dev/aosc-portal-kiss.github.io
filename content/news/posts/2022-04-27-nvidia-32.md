title: "Recent NVIDIA Proprietary Driver Update May Report File Conflict Errors"
date: 2022-04-27T12:54:47-07:00

A recent update to our NVIDIA proprietary driver package integrated both AMD64
and optenv32 (i686) runtimes to help configure and run 32-bit software like
Steam more easily. However, a slight oversight in the package's metadata
resulted in `nvidia` 510.60.02 failing to replace files from the previous
`nvidia+32` package. 

We're currently working on a fix. If you encounter file conflict errors with
`nvidia` and `nvidia+32` when upgrading AOSC OS, please re-run the upgrade
command:

    sudo apt full-upgrade

to work around the issue. No need to wait for a fixed package.
