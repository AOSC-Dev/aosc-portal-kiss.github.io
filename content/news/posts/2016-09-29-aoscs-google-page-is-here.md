Junde Yhi of our community has decided to maintain a Google+ page, in which he will post the news here at the repo, in addition to some fun tips and chatter with our friends out there.

Check it out [here](https://plus.google.com/u/2/106669966380206498641)!

We are also looking to open up a sub-reddit at /r/aosc some time soon, once we could figure out how and when we could start one.
