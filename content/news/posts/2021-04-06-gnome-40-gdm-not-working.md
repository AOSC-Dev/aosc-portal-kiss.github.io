title: "GDM Not Working on GNOME 40"
date: 2021-04-06T19:33:54+08:00

The testing update of GNOME 40 is now available, and you can enable `gnome-40` topic in ATM to get the update.
However, GDM cannot start due to incorrect configuration of authentication, you may use LightDM / SDDM instead
to start your GNOME / GNOME on Xorg session.

We will release a fix for GDM after this problem is solved.
