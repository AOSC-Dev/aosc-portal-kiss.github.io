It's that time of a year again (to look back), and I am very glad to say that 2016 has been a great year for all of us. 

Lots of news and happenings around our projects, and we have got couple of new faces to our community's development effort - most notably, Yi "Everette" Rong, who kickstarted the big endian PowerPC ports for AOSC OS, and to top things off, made an experimental go at AOSC OS on Windows 10 with his WSAOSC (Wa-Sao-sk) installer, check it out [here](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/WSAOSC/).

Not to be out done, Icenowy Zheng made an explosive progress on AOSC OS's ARM ports with her [aosc-mkrawimg](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/aosc-mkrawimg/) and [aosc-os-arm-boot-flasher](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/aosc-os-arm-boot-flasher/) projects. Dozens of images are released for Allwinner devices and Raspberry Pi, and Kernel updates on these devices got more and more intuitive.

Progress on our localization effort were looking better than ever, we have continued our effort with Simplified Chinese localization for FOSS projects. GNOME, MATE, Audacious, Freedesktop.org, etc. have received our continued support in this particular area. Most notably, with joint effort from Arthur Wang, Zixing Liu, and I personally, Wine's zh_CN translation had reached 100% completion for the first time since 1993 - and yes, that's when the project started.

Looking ahead, 2017 will be equally if not more interesting for AOSC. Development will be resumed on AST's Startup Toolkit with a brand new UI and more universal support for Linux distributions other than AOSC OS; RISC-V will (potentially) see its first commercial hardware debut, and thus a new port for AOSC OS is imminent; ACBS, a replacement for our [ABBS](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/abbs/) will bring better reliability, multi-tree support (forest.conf), and security to our AOSC OS packaging work. And of course, AOSC OS will see more improvement on dependencies, installation support, and user experience.

Before we get carried away, this has been an awesome year coordinating this community and working with all of you guys. And here to my sincere gratitude, and I wish all of you a happy new year!
