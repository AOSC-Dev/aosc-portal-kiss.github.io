Core 4.0.1 is now available for all architectures supported by AOSC OS:

- ARM64 (arm64)
- ARMv7 (armel)
- MIPS32 (mipsel)
- PowerPC (powerpc)
- PowerPC64 (ppc64)
- x86_64 (amd64)

This is a bugfix release to Core 4.0.0, which fixes an issue that Perl is unable to find programs installed in its site/vendor package directories, and some build failures on PowerPC and MIPS32 architectures.

For the original changelog, see [here](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/aosc-os-core/releases/tag/v4.0.1).

Wallpapers updated for Core 4.0.1 are also available through [here](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/aosc-os-artworks/releases/tag/v20160924). These wallpapers will soon be shipped as part of the `desktop-base` package - as an update in about a week.
