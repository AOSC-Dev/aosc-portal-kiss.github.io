Last week, the curl upstream [notified distributions and users](https://github.com/curl/curl/discussions/12026) of what was "probably the worst curl security flaw in a long time." This security vulnerability has been addressed at 6:00, UTC time. AOSC OS has since made the update available in the stable repository, we suggest that users and developers update their systems at their earliest convenience.

If you are using an apt/oma mirror other than the [community repository](repo.aosc.io), you may not receive this update for another 24 hours. We suggest that you switch your mirror to the community repository to update your system:

```
sudo apt-gen-list set-mirror origin
```
