LZUOSS (兰大开源社区) has started mirroring our [community repository](https://repo.aosc.io) on their [LZUOSS OSS Mirror](http://mirror.lzu.edu.cn/).

You may now enable this mirror with the following command:

    apt-gen-list -e '20-lzuoss'

After you have updated your `apt-gen-list` package to version `20161003` or newer.

Thanks to their contribution, users from the Mid-West China should be able to access our repository content at faster speeds.
