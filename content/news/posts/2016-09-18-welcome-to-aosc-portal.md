Goodbye, Temporary Portal, you served us well (not!)...

It's been a long time since this [next-gen portal](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/website-site-ng) has first started, it was the summer of 2015. It has been quite a difficult journey for us, frontend was never our strongest point, in addition to being full time students, we haven't been able to finish the new site in a timely fashion. And we do apologize for showing that eye watering Temporary Portal for such a long time (15 months, can you believe that!).

Anyhow, it's here, and we hope that you enjoy your visit. Please report any issues experienced, or perhaps advices for us to improve this site to the [issue list](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/website-site-ng/issues).
