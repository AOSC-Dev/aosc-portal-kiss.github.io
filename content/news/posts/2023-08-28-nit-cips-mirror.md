[Nanyang Institute of Technology's Computer and Information Processing Society (CIPS)](https://mirror.nyist.edu.cn/) mirror for our community repository is now live, with 10Gbps IPv6 bandwidth! This new mirror, powered by a brand-new student society and their brand-new devices, will surely not disappoint.

We would like to extend our utmost gratitude for our friends at NIT-CIPS. Thank you!
