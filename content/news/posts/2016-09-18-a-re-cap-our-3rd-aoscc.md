So here's a (very) late recap on the 3rd AOSCC (AOSC Conference) held in Shanghai, on July 16-18. Several first's were achieved this year:

- This is the first time that our annual get-together was sponsored by a University student organization - the [Geek Pie Association](https://www.geekpie.org/).
- We have got more than 35 attendees having fun these three days, a ~40% boost from last year's record (just to see how small of a conference it was).
- We have (finally) got a successful workshop session on the third day.

Several community matters were determined for the coming year:

- AOSCC 2017 will be held in the summer in Guangzhou, China.
- The next Core release, Core 4 series, will be codenamed ["Duang-Duang"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duang).
- A PowerPC and PowerPC64 (PPC64) port will be available as part of the Core 4 update.
- A default wallpaper is chosen for AOSC OS, it will be presented in a later news post.
