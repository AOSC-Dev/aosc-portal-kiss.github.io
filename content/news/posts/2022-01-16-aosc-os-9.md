AOSC OS Core 9 (Codename "Icenowy") will see availability in the stable repository today.
It mainly includes updates for core system runtime and toolchain, including the GNU C Library (Glibc) 2.34, GCC 11, and Binutils 2.37.

Though we have done plenty of testing with the Core 9 runtime updates, should you encounter any issues after the update,
please consider joining our [AOSC Community Channel](https://t.me/+QVkNCQXYd_kAOMTX) or open a bug report at our [aosc-os-abbs](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/aosc-os-abbs/issues/new/choose) repository.
