Our friends at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University's *NIX User Group (SJTUG)](https://sjtug.org/) have just set up yet another mirror for our community repository. SJTUG's mirror will provide fast and reliable service for our users in mainland China.

We would like to extend our utmost gratitude for our friends at SJTUG. Thank you!
