title: "Unusually Large MariaDB Package in general-survey-20210301"

AMD64 updates from the `general-survey-20210301` topic are now available for testing.
This topic includes numerous component updates for databases, development tools and display managers.
At present, we are aware of an issue where `maridab` (MySQL) is unusually large due to incorrect build parameters.
This issue should not affect functionality, but we will release a fix as soon as possible.
