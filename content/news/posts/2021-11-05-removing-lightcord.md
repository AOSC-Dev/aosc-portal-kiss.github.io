Lightcord users be advised:

As the Lightcord upstream has terminated maintenance and development on the project, we will remove the lightcord package from our community repository soon.

The upstream developers had recently made an announcement that [Lightcord has been abandoned and will no longer receive support or updates](https://github.com/Lightcord/Lightcord#lightcord-has-been-abandoned-and-no-longer-receives-support-or-updates), and recommends that users remove Lightcord from your systems to ensure the security of your account (as Discord may ban accounts logging in from Lightcord) and personal information. Please execute the following command to remove Lightcord:

    apt purge lightcord

If you would like to use a 3rd party client for Discord, the Lightcord developers has made a [website](https://lightcord.site/) showcasing various alternative clients.
