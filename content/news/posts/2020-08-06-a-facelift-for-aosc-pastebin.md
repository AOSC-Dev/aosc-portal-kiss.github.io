title: A Facelift for AOSC Pastebin
date: '2020-08-06'

The AOSC Pastebin has recently gone through a facelift.

The new pastebin is a proxy to our old pastebin service, with a completely redesigned
UI that more closely resembles our main website, and uses no JavaScript in
order to improve compatibility, accessibility, and speed.

The new pastebin is now online, accessible at https://paste.aosc.io .

Any Compatibility Issues?
-------------------------
As far as we know, currently most of the basic functions are fully supported by the new
Pastebin system. This includes basic pasting, setting title, deactivating, and set
expiration time.

A few functions are however left off. This includes:
- Multiple attachments: one attachment shall be sufficient. By the way, who uses a Pastebin to store attachments, especially in binary format?
- Syntax highlighting: This unfortunately was accomplished in JavaScript, so for now forget about it.
- Password: It is slightly more complex. It might be included in a future update though.

This info would be updated on the new pastebin's [about page](https://paste.aosc.io/about.html).

How About Our Old Pastebin? 
---------------------------

For those who still miss the good'ol Pastebin that is now serving as the backend of our
new Pastebin, either because they need a function that is not offered in the new Pastebin
as indicated above, or they can't give up the convenience offered by the JavaScript
such as the eyecandies and the syntax highlighting, or because they just have too much
computational power to waste (Hey you are blessed!), please beware that
our old Pastebin is still running on https://pastebin.aosc.io . A link is also offered
at the bottom of each paste on the new Pastebin, to allow users to view them on the old
Pastebin.

Hey I've Got a Question!

Enjoy Pasting the AOSC way!
