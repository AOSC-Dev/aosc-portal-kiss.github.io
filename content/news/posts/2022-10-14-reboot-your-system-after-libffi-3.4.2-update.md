Based on our experience with the recent `libffi` 3.4.2 update, we suggest that
you reboot AOSC OS at your earliest convenience. After updating this package,
you may experience lock-ups when attempting to copy and paste texts and/or
other objects, or while trying to attach files in an e-mail client.

Should you experience such issues, consider rebooting AOSC OS.
