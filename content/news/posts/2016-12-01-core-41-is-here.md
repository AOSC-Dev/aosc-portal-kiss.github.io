Core 4.1 was released just now as a major feature update to the Core 4.0 series. Core 4.1 contains:

- Fixes to issues discovered since the release of Core 4.0.1 (last release in the 4.0 series).
- Features updates/additions to Core.
- Performance improvements.
- Security fixes.

And most notably, GCC now comes with Go language support, and now you may switch between the Google and the GNU implementation. Many changes were also put into a new Glibc update, like the Unicode 9.0 update. Also, we have disabled any non-Unicode locale by default to save some time and disk space when updating Glibc (you can still enable them by editing `/etc/locale.gen`).

Some details were changed in the AOSC OS base definition package (aosc-aaa) as well, `/etc/os-release` now includes a new field for `BUILD_ID`, as exposed in GNOME as follows:

A full changelog for Core 4.1 is available [here](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/aosc-os-core/releases/tag/v4.1.0-2).

Note: This version of Core contains security update for Glibc, for [AOSA-2016-0030](https://aosc.io/news/aosa-2016-0030-update-glibc-to-2.24-2), therefore it it strongly suggested for you to update if you are using ARMv7 (`armel`) port of AOSC OS!
