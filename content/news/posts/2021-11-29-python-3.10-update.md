Here comes the Python 3.10 update! This update affects over 20% of all packages in the repository.
Due to the sheer volume of updates, we could not possibly test every single update, and certain
issues may have fallen through the cracks. If you encounter usability issues and other bugs with
certain applications after the update, please consider reporting them via our
[Telegram Group](https://t.me/+QVkNCQXYd_kAOMTX), [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/VYPHgt9),
IRC (#aosc @ Libera.Chat) or [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/aosc-os-abbs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug-report.yml).
