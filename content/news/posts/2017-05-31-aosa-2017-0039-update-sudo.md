Please update your `sudo` package to version `1.8.20p1`.

A recently released version of Sudo has addressed a security vulnerability titled "Potential overwrite of arbitrary files on Linux":

*"On Linux systems, sudo parses the /proc/[pid]/stat file to determine the device number of the process's tty (field 7). The fields in the file are space-delimited, but it is possible for the command name (field 2) to include spaces, which sudo does not account for. A user with sudo privileges can cause sudo to use a device number of the user's choosing by creating a symbolic link from the sudo binary to a name that contains a space, followed by a number."*

This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2017-100036](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000367).
