Please update your `bash` package to version `4.4.12`.

At patch level 7, which would be version `4.4.7` of Bash, a security issue was addressed that:

*"An exploit can be realized by creating a file or directory with a specially crafted name. A user utilizing GNU Bashâ€™s built-in path completion by hitting the Tab button (f.e. to remove it with rm) triggers the exploit without executing a command itself. The vulnerability has been introduced on the devel-branch in May 2015."*

And was consequently assigned [CVE-2017-5932](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5932).
