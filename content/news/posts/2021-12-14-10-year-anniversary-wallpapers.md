Happy birthday, AOSC! For the past few weeks, [@Megabits](https://megabits.xyz/) actively worked with us on designing our 10th anniversary [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oD7kVIjCyw) and wallpapers (see below, click the thumbnails to view and download the original images), we are very excited to see these beautiful artwork.

10 year is only a starting point. We will work along side you in the future to provide a stable and elegant Linux experience.
