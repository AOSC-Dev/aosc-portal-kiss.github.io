With sincere gratitude, I would like to announce our new sponsor - [CodeWeavers](https://www.codeweavers.com/)!
CodeWeavers works with [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) to create
application-specific solutions and consultant services for running Windows
applications on Linux and macOS. Earlier today, we received a one-time $500
donation from CodeWeavers to fund our new [Mac mini M1 build server](https://wiki.aosc.io/community/crowdsourcing/mac-mini-m1/).

We have also just launched our [GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/AOSC-Dev),
intended for use in AOSC's hardware and service purchases. Due to the lack
of financial account or management infrastructure (as intended), we require
pre-designated usage for all donations in the form of Crowdsourcing.
