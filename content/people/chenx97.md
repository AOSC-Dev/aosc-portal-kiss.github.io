Usability First, Freedom Second
===============================

Seriously. Please don't settle with bad usability just because you are making
FOSS products.

How?
----

Explore the following aspects of user testing to help yourself out.

- Ease of learning
- Error frequency, severity, and recovery
- Efficiency of use
- Memorability
- User satisfaction

“Evaluating and Testing Technical Documents.” _Technical Communication_, by Mike Markel and Stuart A. Selber, Bedford/St. Martin's, 2018.

Why?
----

Take a look at the propular FOSS products. You will realize that people enjoy
using them, and the biggest reasons are likely not that they are free. People
only use programs that actually help them. Pricing, freedom and privacy are not
as important as usability to the vast majority of netizens. Be realistic.

Let's make FOSS better.
