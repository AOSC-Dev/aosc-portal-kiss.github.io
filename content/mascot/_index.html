        An-An was born a rabbit, but found herself a girl with bunny ears and tails
        when she woke up one day. She couldn't seem to remember why.

      <p>
        She is introverted, but only when without her friends' company - she is
        warmhearted, patient, and a self-proclaimed meme lord.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          She was stubborn and uncompromising as a child, and once picked a nasty fight in a Linux
          community. She regretted that ever since, and vowed to change. She
          settled down for years to study the ways around open source software
          and culture, but she kept much of her rebellious insistences.
        </li>
        <li>
          In her community, she is one with many friendships, despite being
          socially awkward.
        </li>
        <li>
          She believes in personal choices, and that each person has their own
          best set of tools in mind.
        </li>
        <li>
          To her, a community is there for fun and skill sharing, and she makes
          her best effort to make Linux more useful.
        </li>
        <li>
          Instead of a diary, she keeps a book of memes and jokes from her
          community.
        </li>
        <li>
          A hopeless workaholic, she could not work without her music. She takes
          her work seriously, and never spares any detail. However, she makes
          sure to acknowledge others' efforts.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        She is a multilinguist and a localisation and typesetting enthusiast.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          She hoards good looking fonts, and believes that good fonts accentuate
          beautiful texts.
        </li>
        <li>
          She is sensitive to language organisation, and is obsessed with
          "proper translation."

            <li>
              Her cabinets at home are overflowing with old computers and weird
              gadgets. She even gave each of them random names.
            </li>
            <li>Her room is always steamy with over ten computers running 24/7.</li>
            <li>She has a pet server called "Shrimpie."</li>
