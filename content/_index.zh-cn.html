    <p>欢迎来到 Anthon Open Source Community - AOSC OS 之家！</p>
    <p>
        AOSC OS is a general purpose Linux distribution that strives
        to simplify user experience and improve free and open source
        software for day-to-day productivity.

    <p>AOSC OS is designed around the following principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Simplified: no package should be split unless necessary. </li>
        <li>Localised: equal functionality across different languages.</li>
        <li>Permissive: freedom to choose free or proprietary software.</li>
        <li>Sustainable: long-term support for aging hardware.</li>
        <li>Refined: all but minor improvements.</li>
    </ul>

        At AOSC, we consider our common interest as the discovery of fun
        in computing. Over the years, AOSC has focused most of its
        development effort on the AOSC OS project, with various other
        projects spun out from community interests.
