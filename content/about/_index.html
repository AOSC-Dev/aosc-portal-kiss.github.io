    <p>
        AOSC was originally founded as Anthon.Dev (Anthon Dev. Team)
        by Mingcong Bai and his two classmates in late 2011. Following
        a year of mismanagement, the team was disbanded and refactored
        as the Anthon Open Source Community in late 2012.
    </p>
    <p>
        AOSC OS, the community's main project, was originally known as
        AnthonOS - an OpenSUSE derivative built with the now defunct
        SUSE Studio. The OS project was then remade as a Debian
        derivative focusing on a customised KDE 4 UI and CJK support.

        In 2014, with the help of Icenowy Zheng, developer of the
        Eastern Heart Linux distribution, the Anthon :Next project was
        established to rebuild the distribution from scratch. With the
        rebuild, AnthonOS was renamed as AOSC OS, and has become the
        general-purpose distribution as we know it today.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the following years, AOSC OS expanded its package repostory
        and scope of arcthitectural support. To this day, AOSC OS
        continues to diversify its software selection and device
        support, owing to our developer's dedication.

        Without the support from our generous sponsors, AOSC, our
        volunteer-driven community will not have survived. Here below
