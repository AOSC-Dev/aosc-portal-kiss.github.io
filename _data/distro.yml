        a small footprint. XFCE can run very quick even on older machines while
        providing a complete desktop experience, making it a near perfect choice
        for performance constrained devices.
    - name: MATE
      description: |
        MATE is a desktop environment that sticks to the traditions - in which
        the developers of this particular desktop environment believe. Being a
        fork of GNOME 2, MATE never has been a desktop of the past during its
        development history. MATE continuously updates itself to the newest
        technologies while tries its best to provide users with a familiar
        desktop experience.
    - name: Cinnamon
      description: |
        Cinnamon was initially a fork of GNOME Shell in an effor to provide a
        traditional interface suitable for keyboard and mouse. Cinnamon builds
        upon GNOME's technical frameworks and applications, preserving the
        same ease of use in mind, while providing more customizability.
    - name: LXDE
      description: |
        LXDE, or Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment in full is a lightweight
        desktop environment with a seemingly microscopic memory footprint. This
        is one of the better choices to go for on a older PC or low performance
        device. LXDE is extremely customizable, a perfect choice for those
        looking for a full desktop environment while wanting to keep in control
        of every aspect of their desktop.
    - name: Base
      description: |
        While AOSC OS focuses itself in providing complete and refined desktop
        experience in all other variants, we understand that there are
        those who prefers all choices remained on their hands. The Base
        variant provides a minimal set of features, just enough for you to get
        started. Base is still a pre-configured variant - like AOSC OS should
        be - this is also suitable for performance constrained devices like say,
        a Raspberry Pi board; or simply drop it on your server and go from there.
        Base is also available as a Docker image.
    - name: BuildKit
      description: |
        BuildKit is essentially a non-bootable AOSC OS Base with full
        development support. This particular variant of AOSC OS comes with
        Autobuild3 and ABBS so you can jump right into AOSC OS packaging,
        whether it be a contribution to our official ABBS tree, or something
        you have decided to build on your own. BuildKit is also available as
        a Docker image.
