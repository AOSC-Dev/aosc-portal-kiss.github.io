        those who prefers all choices remained on their hands. The Base
        variant provides a minimal set of features, just enough for you to get
        started. Base is still a pre-configured variant like other AOSC OS variants.
        Therefore, Base is suitable for performance constrained devices and servers.
        Base is also available as a Docker image.
