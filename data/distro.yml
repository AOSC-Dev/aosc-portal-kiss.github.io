        While AOSC OS focuses itself in providing complete and refined desktop
        experience in all other variants, we understand that there are
        those who prefers all choices remained on their hands. The Base
        variant provides a minimal set of features, just enough for you to get
        started. Base is still a pre-configured variant - like AOSC OS should
        be - this is also suitable for performance constrained devices like say,
        a Raspberry Pi board; or simply drop it on your server and go from there.
        Base is also available as a Docker image.

        development support. This particular variant of AOSC OS comes with
        Autobuild3 and ABBS so you can jump right into AOSC OS packaging,
        whether it be a contribution to our official ABBS tree, or something
        you have decided to build on your own. BuildKit is also available as
        a Docker image.
