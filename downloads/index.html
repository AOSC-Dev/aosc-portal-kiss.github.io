                            GNOME is a desktop environment with a strong emphasis on human
                            interactivity, multilingual support, and accessibility. Designed as
                            a desktop for humanity, GNOME provides users with a minimal yet elegant
                            interface for those who may understand its innovative logic in desktop
                            computing.
