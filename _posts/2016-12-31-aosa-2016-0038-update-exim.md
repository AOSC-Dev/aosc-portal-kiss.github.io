Please update your `exim` package to version `4.88`.

A security vulnerability was recently disclosed that:

*"Exim leaks the private DKIM signing key to the log files.  Additionally,
if the build option ```EXPERIMENTAL_DSN_INFO=yes``` is used, the key material
is included in the bounce message."*

And was consequently assigned with [CVE-2016-9963](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9963).
