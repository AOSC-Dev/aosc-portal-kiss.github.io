MATE Desktop 1.16 is a major update over version 1.14 released six months ago:

- More fixes to GTK+ 3 support.
- Migrated multiple applications to the new GApplications API.

While it might sound pretty trivial to you, in other words: MATE Desktop 1.16 should provide a more stable and modern user experience, and possibly some less bugs as well!
