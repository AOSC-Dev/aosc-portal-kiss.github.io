Along with the update, Zheng is currently marking all `optenv32`, our i686/32-bit x86 runtime environment as architectural neutral packages - in the future, all of our AOSC OS ports will be able to run i686 applications (Wine or Linux Native) with the help of Qemu User Mode Emulation. Keep posted for updates!
