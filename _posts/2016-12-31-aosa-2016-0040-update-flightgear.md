Please update your `flightgear` package to version `2016.4.3-1`.

A fix was recently introduced to the source code for the FlightGear Flight Simulator to address the following security vulnerability:

- [CVE-2016-9956](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9956)

*"The FlightGear project fixed a security issue, allowing arbitrary file
overwrites for files the user running FlightGear has write access to
and could be taken advantage to for other impact as arbitrary code
execution."*
