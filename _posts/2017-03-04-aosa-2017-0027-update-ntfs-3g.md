Please update your `ntfs-3g` package to version `2016.2.22-1`.

A security vulnerability assigned with  [CVE-2017-0358](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-0358) was addressed in NTFS-3G.

*Jann Horn, Project Zero (Google) discovered that ntfs-3g, a read-write
NTFS driver for FUSE does not not scrub the environment before
executing modprobe to load the fuse module. This influence the behavior
of modprobe (MODPROBE_OPTIONS environment variable, --config and
--dirname options) potentially allowing for local root privilege
escalation if ntfs-3g is installed setuid. This is the case for Debian,
Ubuntu and probably Gentoo.
