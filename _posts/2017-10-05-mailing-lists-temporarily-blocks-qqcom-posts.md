Due to recent flooding of messages from various @qq.com (bots?) to our "discussions" list, we have currently taken emergency - and temporary - measure against **all** posts from @qq.com e-mail addresses.

If you own such e-mail account and wish to post on our mailing lists, we do apologise for your inconvenience. Please, for now, switch to another e-mail account - or create one elsewhere - for posting on our lists.

We will keep you updated if we are ready with a more scientific and appropriate solution.
