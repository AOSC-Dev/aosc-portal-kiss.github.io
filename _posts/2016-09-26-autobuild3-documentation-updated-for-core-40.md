The *"AOSC Cadet Training"* - a handbook for new AOSC OS packagers - has been updated by Mingcong Bai with information about new configuration options, changes, and syntactic sugar (and of course, those deprecated with the update), here below is a quick re-cap of what's changed:

- `autobuild/defines` has received some new configuration options:
  - `AB_FLAGS_O3` for switching between `-O2` and `-O3` optimization level;
  - `AB_FLAGS_SPECS` for toggling the use of compiler/linker hardening specs on/off;
  - LTO is now enabled by default on `amd64/x86_64`;
- `autobuild/pax` specifies post-installation operations to mark executables/libraries/directories for PaX/Grsecurity compatibility;
- Autobuild3 now processes architecture-aware patches contained in `autobuild/patches/` with architectural suffixes;
- The old `perl_local` Autobuild3 filter is now renamed as `perl`, which additionally purges all `.packlist` files in the packaging root;
