Just a quick notice that we have fixed the issue earlier today and a full package scan has been completed. This issue was fixed with [this commit](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/p-vector/commit/bcbb7d1470915114ee38d75ab878b7aa23fa8ad8). We will post a news update about the new wave of updates shortly.
