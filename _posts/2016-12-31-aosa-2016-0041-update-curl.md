Please update your `curl` (and `curl+32` if using the AMD64/x86_64 port with optenv32 installed) to version `7.52.1`.

This security advisory discusses the security vulnerabilities addressed in 7.52.0 and followed by 7.52.1 as an emergency release - to fix a new security regression introduced with version 7.52.0.

Version 7.52.0 addressed the following security vulnerabilities:

[CVE-2016-9586](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9586), [CVE-2016-9952](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9952), [CVE-2016-9953](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9953).

Version 7.52.1 address a security vulnerability described as follows, however, no CVE was assigned at the time of writing:

*"libcurl's (new) internal function that returns a good 32bit random value was
implemented poorly and overwrote the pointer instead of writing the value into
the buffer the pointer pointed to.*

*"This random value is used to generate nonces for Digest and NTLM
authentication, for generating boundary strings in HTTP formposts and
more. Having a weak or virtually non-existent random there makes these
operations vulnerable.*

*"This function is brand new in 7.52.0 and is the result of an overhaul to make
sure libcurl uses strong random as much as possible - provided by the backend
TLS crypto libraries when present. The faulty function was introduced in [this
commit](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/f682156a4fc6c43fb)."*
