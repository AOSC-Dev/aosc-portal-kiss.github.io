With the hard work of our community infrastructure contributors, there are now two more services available for our community members:

- [AOSC OS Packages](https://packages.aosc.io): A catalog of packages available for AOSC OS.
- [Mailing Lists](https://lists.aosc.io): Community mailing lists for discussions, advisories, and announcements.

AOSC OS Packages
----------------

Thanks to Dingyuan Wang ([gumblex](https://aosc.io/people/~gumblex)) for creating this website.

It should not take much explanation for our Packages site - as mentioned above, it is a catalog of AOSC OS packages - and you could now search for a particular package available to AOSC OS (or to find out if it's available yet), check on update status, and compare versions of a given package available to all our AOSC OS ports.

Dingyuan Wang also mentioned that there will be a function where AOSC OS users could file package requests on the same website, making it easier for users and developers to check on request status.

Mailing Lists
-------------

Thanks to Sijie Bu ([butangmucat](https://aosc.io/people/~butangmucat)) for making this service available.

Currently there are four mailing lists available, each dedicated to different functions...

- [announcements@lists.aosc.io](https://lists.aosc.io/sympa/info/announcements): for community events and project-related announcements; broadcast only, read-only to subscribers.
- [discussions@lists.aosc.io](https://lists.aosc.io/sympa/info/discussions): for development discussions, questions, and suggestions; open to users and developers, subscription required.
- [mirrors@lists.aosc.io](https://lists.aosc.io/sympa/info/mirrors): announcements on maintenance and status of our mirrors; broadcast only, read-only to subscribers.
- [security@lists.aosc.io](https://lists.aosc.io/sympa/info/security): bulletin for security updates, CVEs, etc; broadcast only, read-only to subscribers.
